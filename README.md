# Curses-pyi
 Just a public repo to hold a .pyi file for Curses, which can be useful if your IDE isn't able to provide type hinting with the official library. E.g. when you are using windows-curses and VSCode, you can place this file in a "typings" folder. PyLance has options to set the default typings folder.
